Let me make this very clear. Computer programming is hard. Really hard. It is a long road from where you are, little butterfly, to the top of the mountain. A programming expert. A real guru. Right now you're not even an amateur, don't you dare put that on your resume. You're nothing. You think you're some shit, no, you're a script kiddie who downloaded some warez of the internet and pushed a button. So listen carefully - before you begin writing your first lines of code, get familiar with basic concepts in abstract algebra, discrete mathematics, and computational complexity theory. Don't even dream of getting a job before you've mastered the polynomial hierarchy. Read all 8 volumes of "The art of computer programming". Do all the exercises. Then read "Concrete mathematics", and then read the proof of the PCP theorem, from start to end, in one go. If you don't understand it, go to step 1 and repeat. Invent your own assembly language, and write a C compiler with it. Then run it by hand. On the linux kernel. Step by step, pen and paper. And when you've finally reached the end of the boot sequence, get started on a python interpreter. And when you've had your first dream in MIX, wake from that dream and write that down come to me. If it compiles , you're ready to begin your journey. You're not an expert in programming by any means, but you've mastered the basics. You're worthy of touching a compiler. A job as a programmer? that's decades away. Maybe a few lifetimes. If you even get there. But lets celebrate the small victories.

Open your terminal. Type python. Then:

print("Hello World")
